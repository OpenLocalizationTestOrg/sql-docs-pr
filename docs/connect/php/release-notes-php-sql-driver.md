# Release Notes for the Microsoft Drivers for PHP for SQL Server

[!INCLUDE[Driver_PHP_Download](../../includes/driver_php_download.md)]

This page discusses what was added in each version of the [!INCLUDE[ssDriverPHP](../../includes/ssdriverphp_md.md)].  

<!--
Hello, We are standardizing the format of content inside our Release Notes (or What's New) articles.
Instead of bullets (or paragraphs), we have shifted to the 2-column format you see for H2 **What's New in Version 5.6**.
It is not necessary to reformat all the older H2 sections in this Release Notes file, but.....

Going forward, please be sure to use the 2-column format.

Also, all Release Notes .md file names now must begin with 'release-notes-*.md'.  And no filler words.
The 5.6 edition of this file is being renamed.....
FROM:  'release-notes-for-the-php-sql-driver.md'
TO  :  'release-notes-php-sql-driver.md'

For any questions, ask GeneMi or CraigG.
Thanks a lot.  2019-03-28  (DevO= 1467988)
